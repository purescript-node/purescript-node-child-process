-- | This module contains various types and functions to allow you to spawn and
-- | interact with child processes.
-- |
-- | It is intended to be imported qualified, as follows:
-- |
-- | ```purescript
-- | import Node.ChildProcess as ChildProcess
-- | -- or...
-- | import Node.ChildProcess as CP
-- | ```
-- |
-- | The [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html)
-- | forms the basis for this module and has in-depth documentation about
-- | runtime behaviour.
-- |
-- | ## Meaning of `appendStdio`
-- |
-- | By default, `ChildProcess` uses `safeStdio` for its `stdio` option. However,
-- | Node allows one to pass in additional values besides the typical 3 (i.e. `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`)
-- | and the IPC channel that might be used (i.e. `ipc`). Thus, `appendStdio` is an option
-- | defined in this library that doesn't exist in the Node docs.
-- | It exists to allow the end-user to append additional values to the `safeStdio` value
-- | used here. For example,
-- | 
-- | ```
-- | spawn' file args (_ { appendStdio = Just [ fileDescriptor8, pipe, pipe ]})
-- | ```
-- |
-- | would end up calling `spawn` with the following `stdio`:
-- | ```
-- | -- i.e. `safeStdio <> [ fileDescriptor8, pipe, pipe ]`
-- | [pipe, pipe, pipe, ipc, fileDescriptor8, pipe, pipe]
-- | ```

-- | - `cwd` <string> | <URL> Current working directory of the child process.
-- | - `detached` <boolean> Prepare child to run independently of its parent process. Specific behavior depends on the platform, see options.detached).
-- | - `env` <Object> Environment key-value pairs. Default: process.env.
-- | - `execPath` <string> Executable used to create the child process.
-- | - `execArgv` <string[]> List of string arguments passed to the executable. Default: process.execArgv.
-- | - `gid` <number> Sets the group identity of the process (see setgid(2)).
-- | - `serialization` <string> Specify the kind of serialization used for sending messages between processes. Possible values are 'json' and 'advanced'. See Advanced serialization for more details. Default: 'json'.
-- | - `signal` <AbortSignal> Allows closing the child process using an AbortSignal.
-- | - `killSignal` <string> | <integer> The signal value to be used when the spawned process will be killed by timeout or abort signal. Default: 'SIGTERM'.
-- | - `silent` <boolean> If true, stdin, stdout, and stderr of the child will be piped to the parent, otherwise they will be inherited from the parent, see the 'pipe' and 'inherit' options for child_process.spawn()'s stdio for more details. Default: false.
-- | - `uid` <number> Sets the user identity of the process (see setuid(2)).
-- | - `windowsVerbatimArguments` <boolean> No quoting or escaping of arguments is done on Windows. Ignored on Unix. Default: false.
-- | - `timeout` <number> In milliseconds the maximum amount of time the process is allowed to run. Default: undefined.
