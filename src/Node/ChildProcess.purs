-- | This module contains various types and functions to allow you to spawn and
-- | interact with child processes.
-- |
-- | It is intended to be imported qualified, as follows:
-- |
-- | ```purescript
-- | import Node.ChildProcess (ChildProcess, CHILD_PROCESS)
-- | import Node.ChildProcess as ChildProcess
-- | ```
-- |
-- | The [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html)
-- | will probably also be useful to read if you want to use this module.
